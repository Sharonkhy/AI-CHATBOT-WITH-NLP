*DESCRIPTION:* This Python script creates a rule-based chatbot enhanced with Natural Language Processing (NLP) using two popular libraries: NLTK and spaCy. The bot can understand user queries, provide responses, and handle basic conversations intelligently.

1. Purpose of the Chatbot
The chatbot is designed to:
  - Answer user questions based on predefined rules.
  - Understand natural language using NLP techniques.
  - Provide meaningful responses even if the exact wording varies.
  - Fall back gracefully when it doesn’t understand a query.
It can be used for customer support, FAQs, or simple interactive tasks.

2. Key Libraries Used
A) NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
   - Used for basic text processing (tokenization, word matching).
   - Implements a rule-based chat system using predefined question-answer pairs.
   - Handles simple conversations like greetings, goodbyes, and common queries.
B) spaCy
   - Provides advanced NLP capabilities (entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging).
   - Helps detect names, dates, verbs, and other language patterns.
   - Enhances responses when the bot needs deeper text understanding.
  
3. Limitations & Possible Improvements
❌ Limited to Predefined Rules – Can’t answer unscripted questions well.
❌ No Memory – Doesn’t remember past conversations.

*LEARNING OUTCOMES:*
- Understood rule-based chatbot design using NLTK’s pattern-response pairs.
- Applied basic NLP techniques (entity recognition, POS tagging) via spaCy.
- Handled errors gracefully, including model downloads and fallback responses.
- Improved Python skills with regex, library integration (NLTK/spaCy), and structured coding.
- Recognized limitations of rule-based systems vs. machine learning approaches.
- Gained foundation for advanced AI chatbots, paving the way for transformers/APIs.
- Developed debugging and problem-solving skills in NLP contexts.
